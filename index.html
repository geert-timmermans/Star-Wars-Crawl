            <p>A long long time ago<br>
                in a galaxy far away<br>
                Naboo was under an attack<br>
                And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn<br>
                Could talk the Federation into<br>
                Maybe cutting them a little slack<br>
                But their response, it didn't thrill us<br>
                They locked the doors and tried to kill us<br>
                We escaped from that gas<br>
                Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass<br>
                We took a bongo from the scene<br>
                And we went to Theed to see the queen<br>
                We all wound up on Tatooine<br>
                That's where we found this boy...<br><br><br><br>
            </p>
            <p>Oh my my, this here Anakin guy<br>
                May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry<br>
                And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye<br>
                Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
                "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br><br><br>  
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you know this junkyard slave<br>
                Isn't even old enough to shave<br>
                But he can use the Force they say<br>
                Ahh, do you see him hitting on the queen<br>
                Though he's just nine and she's fourteen<br>
                Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday<br>
                Well, I know he built C-3PO<br>
                And I've heard how fast his pod can go<br>
                And we were broke, it's true<br>
                So we made a wager or two<br>
                He was a prepubescent flyin' ace<br>
                And the minute Jabba started off that race<br>
                Well, I know who would win first place<br>
                Oh yes, it was our boy<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We started singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy<br>
                May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry<br>
                And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye<br>
                Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
                "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we finally got to Coruscant<br>
                The Jedi Council we knew would want<br>
                To see how good the boy could be<br>
                So we took him there and we told the tale<br>
                How his midi-chlorians were off the scale<br>
                And he might fulfill that prophecy<br>
                Oh, the Council was impressed, of course<br>
                Could he bring balance to the Force?<br>
                They interviewed the kid<br>
                Oh, training they forbid<br>
                Because Yoda sensed in him much fear<br>
                And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here<br>
                Just stick it in your pointy ear<br>
                I still will teach this boy"<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                He was singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy<br>
                May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry<br>
                And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye<br>
                Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
                "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We caught a ride back to Naboo<br>
                'Cause Queen Amidala wanted to<br>
                I frankly would've liked to stay<br>
                We all fought in that epic war<br>
                And it wasn't long at all before<br>
                Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day<br>
                And in the end some Gungans died<br>
                Some ships blew up and some pilots fried<br>
                A lot of folks were croakin'<br>
                The battle droids were broken<br>
                And the Jedi I admire most<br>
                Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast<br>
                Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost<br>
                I guess I'll train this boy<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And I was singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy<br>
                May be Vader someday later - now he's just a small fry<br>
                And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye<br>
                Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
                "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"<br>
                We were singin'... My my, this here Anakin guy<br>

                And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye<br>
